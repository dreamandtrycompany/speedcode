              tech group founded by four friends in college. United by a shared
              passion for innovation and problem-solving, this team isn&apos;t just
              about completing projects—it&apos;s about creating, learning, and
              having fun along the way. With the collaborative efforts, DATCO
              emerged from their collective desire to transform bold ideas into

              SpeedCode, one of DATCO&apos;s flagship projects, is a platform
              designed to make coding more interactive, competitive, and social.
              It brings developers together in real-time through features like
              1v1 live coding battles, a global leaderboard, and practice
              challenges across various programming languages. More than just
              coding in isolation, SpeedCode creates an environment where
              developers can connect, learn, and compete while improving their
              skills. Whether you&apos;re a beginner or an experienced developer,
              SpeedCode transforms routine practice into an engaging experience.
